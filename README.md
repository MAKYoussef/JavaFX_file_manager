# \# Projet\_POO\_AV: Favorite File Manager

# 

# \## Project Description

# 

# This is a \*\*standalone desktop application\*\* developed in \*\*Java\*\* with a \*\*JavaFX\*\* graphical user interface. Its primary goal is to allow the user to easily list, organize, and search through a personal collection of \*\*favorite files\*\*.

# 

# The application uses a system of \*\*Tags\*\* (keywords) to classify files and relies on a \*\*Relational Database (Oracle)\*\* via JDBC for persistence and management of metadata (title, author, tags, summary).

# 

# \*\*\*

# 

# \## Core Features

# 

# \* \*\*File Tagging (CRUD)\*\*: Adding a favorite file, associating detailed descriptions (title, author, tags, summary), modifying, and deleting the file entry.

# \* \*\*Advanced Search\*\*: Allows users to search for favorite files by title, author, or tag.

# \* \*\*Property Listing\*\*: Displays collection statistics, including the total number of favorite files, a list of all authors, and a count of files associated with each tag.

# \* \*\*Data Persistence\*\*: Uses an Oracle Database instance to reliably store all metadata and relationships.

#

# \## Execution Guide

# 

# To run this project, you must configure the classpath to include the libraries in the `lib/` folder.

# 

# 1\.  \*\*Prerequisites\*\* ‚öôÔ∏è: Ensure that the \*\*JDK\*\* (version 11+) and the \*\*Oracle JDBC driver\*\* are installed and configured.

# 2\.  \*\*Database Connection\*\* üíæ: Verify that the Oracle instance is accessible and that the connection details used in the source code are valid.

# 3\.  \*\*Compilation \& Launch\*\* üöÄ: The project must be compiled by including the path to the JavaFX JARs and the dependencies
